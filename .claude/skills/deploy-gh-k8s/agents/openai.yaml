If it failed, inspect logs, fix code/IaC, and report back asking the user to review and re-submit. If it succeeded, run deploy/upgrade.sh, monitor resources with kubectl, troubleshoot errors via describe/logs and fix code/IaC, then ask the user to review and re-submit. If the deployment succeeds, run health checks and report completion."
