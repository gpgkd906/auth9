# QA Test Reports

This directory contains test reports generated by the QA Testing skill.

## Report Naming Convention

**Format**: `{module}_{document}_result_{YYMMDD}.md`

**Examples**:
- `user_01-crud_result_260202.md` - User CRUD tests on Feb 2, 2026
- `tenant_01-crud_result_260202.md` - Tenant CRUD tests on Feb 2, 2026
- `rbac_02-role_result_260203.md` - RBAC role tests on Feb 3, 2026

## Report Structure

Each report includes:

1. **Summary** - Pass/fail counts, pass rate, duration
2. **Detailed Results** - Per-scenario results with:
   - Test steps execution status
   - Database validation results
   - Error details and logs (for failures)
3. **Issues Summary** - Bugs found with severity levels
4. **Recommendations** - Suggested fixes and improvements

## Usage

Reports are automatically generated and saved by the QA Testing skill after completing test execution.

To view reports:
```bash
# List all reports
ls -lh docs/report/

# View specific report
cat docs/report/user_01-crud_result_260202.md

# Find reports by module
ls docs/report/user_*.md

# Find reports by date
ls docs/report/*_260202.md
```

## Cleanup

Old reports can be archived or deleted after issues are resolved:
```bash
# Archive old reports
mkdir -p docs/report/archive/2026-02
mv docs/report/*_260202.md docs/report/archive/2026-02/

# Delete very old reports
rm docs/report/*_250101.md
```

## Integration

Reports can be integrated with:
- Bug tracking systems (extract issues with severity)
- CI/CD pipelines (parse pass rate for quality gates)
- Test management tools (upload for historical tracking)
